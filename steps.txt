## France 
For France I used 50 cities with the highest population number. I found these cities from the following resource https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/cities/france
Next step, I found postal indeces per city using this resource: http://www.geonames.org/postalcode-search.html?q=paris&country=FR
Now I can generate 50 observations per city. API link: https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/seloger/
For Seloger I need 50 calls per week. Thus, 1 account only is fine. 

## UK
For UK I first chose 50 biggest cities using a following source of data: https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/cities/united-kingdom
Next step, I used API calls from Zoopla API and got main neighbourhoods per each city. There are 388 neighbourhoods in total. 
Finally, I use these data for an API call per each neighbourhood. 40 observations per call. For UK I need 1 account per 1 week. API link: https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/zoopla/
For Zoopla I need 388 calls per week, thus 5 accounts.

## USA
For the US I use states and generate 400 observations per state. For Texas I call separately 7 districts.
The reason for that is due to the fact that this state can't be called directly using API for some reason. In total I do 52-5+7=55 calls per week and get around 20 000 observations. 
States missing are Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota. API link: https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/unofficial-redfin/
